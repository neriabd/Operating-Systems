FILES:
osm.cpp -- a file with some code

REMARKS:

Assignment 1:
At first, it created a directory called welcome_dir_1 in the current path, with write execute and read permissions 
for all users (user, group and other),
and a new sub-directory "welcome_dir_2" in the welcome_dir_1 folder with write, execute and read permissions 
for all users (user, group and other).

Then, checked the heap's end address and changed it to 0x55a00659c000.

Then, succesfully opened (or zeroed it if existed) a file called "welcome_file.txt" in directory "welcome_dir_2", 
with write and read permissions for all users (user, group and other),
and succesfully opened the file "etc/localtime" (specifing that the file will be open with read only permissions and
will be closed while calling an execve() system call).

Afterwards, retrieved the file mode and size of file "localtime", which it's size is 2388, with 0644 permmission 
(read and write for owner and read permissions for group and other).
Read up to 4096 bytes (in practice 2388 bytes) from file /etc/localtime and stored them in a given buffer.
Then, moved "/etc/localtime"'s pointer position back by 1506 bytes (to 882) and read since that point until 
the end (1506 bytes), and after that - closed the file.

Retrieved succesfully the file mode and size of the file welcome_file.txt, which it's size is 0, with 
0644 permmission (read and write for owner and read permissions for group and other).
Then, wrote the string "welcome to OS-2023" to welcome_file.txt and closed it.

Finally, it deleted the file welcome_file.txt (from directory ./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2). And afterwards -
deleted "./welcome_dir_1/welcome_dir_2" directory and "./welcome_dir_1" directory (after failing toÂ unlink them).
